# Zombie Blast VR 🧟‍♂️🧟‍♀️

In this project with Virtual Reality, I created a zombie shooter game that simulates users' physical presence in a computer-generated environment. VR gaming systems aim to let users believe they inhabit a virtual world. VR gaming systems simulate a virtual world where players can interact with virtual items and features.
